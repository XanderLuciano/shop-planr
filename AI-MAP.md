## Project Overview

Shop Planr (package name: `shop-erp`) is a job routing and ERP application for machine shops. It tracks production orders (Jobs) through multi-path routing of parts across sequential Process Steps, with serial number management, certificate traceability, progress visualization, and optional Jira integration. Built as a full-stack Nuxt 4 app with SQLite persistence.

**Status**: All features implemented. Job lifecycle management added (scrap, force-complete, flexible advancement, step overrides, waivers, BOM versioning, process/location libraries). Dedicated job creation/edit pages. Serial detail page Routing tab reorganized into SectionCard sections. First-step serial creation panel (SerialCreationPanel) for operator work queue. Operator view redesigned: monolithic operator.vue split into Parts View (/parts), Step View (/parts/step/[stepId]), and Operator Work Queue (/queue). Inline note creation on serial detail page. Step overflow UX: StepTracker uses flex-wrap instead of horizontal scroll, compact step cards, condensed serial counts. Nav page toggles: Settings → Page Visibility tab to hide/show sidebar pages, with route middleware guard and reactive sidebar filtering. Step 1 disabled-after-advance bugfix: zero-serial steps return 200 with partCount:0 instead of 404; first steps always visible in Parts View; prev/next step navigation; deduplicated step headers. Page toggle refresh bugfix: `app/plugins/settings.ts` plugin fetches settings once on app init so sidebar filtering and route middleware have correct toggle state on every page load (no flash, no stale fallback). Nav jobs-to-steps back arrow bugfix: Step View back arrow is context-aware via `from` query parameter, returning to Job detail when navigated from there. Job-step dashboard redirect bugfix: `ALWAYS_ENABLED_ROUTES` constant in `pageToggles.ts` ensures `/parts/step/*` routes are always accessible regardless of the `parts` toggle state. API Documentation CMS: integrated Nuxt Content v3 docs site at `/api-docs` with 67+ endpoint docs across 14 service domains, sidebar navigation, full-text search, EndpointCard MDC component, and responsive docs layout. FK-safe path update: `reconcileSteps()` pure function + `hasStepDependents()` guard replaces delete-and-recreate strategy in `pathService.updatePath()` and `SQLitePathRepository.update()`, preserving step IDs and FK references during path edits (GitHub Issue #9). Path "Done" total fix: `getPathCompletedCount()` returns path-level completed count separately; `getStepDistribution()` no longer copies completed count onto every step entry; API returns `completedCount` as top-level field; frontend uses it directly instead of buggy `.reduce()` sum (GitHub Issue #24). Step "Done" count fix: `getStepDistribution()` now computes correct per-step `completedCount` (parts past step OR completed) instead of hardcoded 0; uses single `listByPathId` query with in-memory filtering instead of N per-step queries (GitHub Issue #50). Job view utilities: JobViewToolbar component with expand/collapse all jobs and paths buttons; JobExpandableRow upgraded to multi-path expansion (Set-based) with signal-driven bulk expand/collapse and throttled concurrent fetching (GitHub Issue #4). Job delete: `deleteJob` + `canDeleteJob` on jobService with safety checks (paths, parts, BOM refs), `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` API route, `countContributingJobRefs` on BomRepository, delete button + confirmation modal on job detail page, 5 property tests (GitHub Issue #46). User admin roles: ShopUser extended with `username` (unique), `displayName`, `isAdmin`; migration 009 replaces `name` column with dedup logic; `useUsers()` composable exposes reactive `isAdmin` computed; job creation, job deletion, and path deletion gated behind admin flag; Admin badge in Settings user list; 8 property tests. Job priority: `priority` INTEGER column on jobs table (migration 010), `bulkUpdatePriority` + `getMaxPriority` on JobRepository, `updatePriorities` on jobService with full validation, `PATCH /api/jobs/priorities` endpoint, `useJobPriority` composable for drag-and-drop editing, priority edit mode on Jobs page (desktop table + mobile cards), 7 property tests + 8 unit tests (GitHub Issue #71). HTTP error handler: centralized `defineApiHandler()` wrapper in `server/utils/httpError.ts` replaces duplicated try/catch blocks across all ~65 API routes; data-driven error-to-HTTP mapping with correct RFC 9110 statusMessage fields; 4 property tests + 11 unit tests (GitHub Issue #28). Admin path delete: admin force-delete for paths with cascade deletion of all dependent records (notes, overrides, cert attachments, step statuses, parts) in FK-safe order within a single transaction; `ForbiddenError` class + 403 HTTP mapping; server-side admin authorization via `userId` in request body; `path_deleted` audit trail entry with deleted part IDs; `PathDeleteButton` updated with UModal confirmation for paths with parts, inline confirmation for zero-part paths; parts browser gains "Scrapped" status filter option; 4 property tests + 12 unit tests. Full frontend with lifecycle dialogs, configuration panels, and audit filters.

## Architecture

```
Components → Composables → API Routes → Services → Repositories → SQLite
   UI only    API client     HTTP glue   Business    Data access    Storage
             (useAuthFetch)               logic
```

Dependencies flow left-to-right only. All business logic lives in services. See `.ai/architecture.md` for details.

## Domain Model

Core entities and relationships:

- **Job** → has many **Paths** (route instances)
- **Path** → has ordered **ProcessSteps**, has many **SerialNumbers**
- **ProcessStep** → belongs to Path, has optional `assignedTo`, `optional` flag, `dependencyType` (physical/preferred/completion_gate)
- **SerialNumber** → belongs to Job + Path, tracks current step index (-1 = completed), has `status` (in_progress/completed/scrapped), scrap fields, force-complete fields, has **CertAttachments**
- **Path** → has `advancementMode` (strict/flexible/per_step)
- **Certificate** → attached to serials at specific steps (many-to-many via cert_attachments, idempotent UNIQUE)
- **TemplateRoute** → deep-cloned when applied to create a Path (template independence preserved)
- **BOM** → has **BomEntries** (part types), each linked to contributing Jobs
- **AuditEntry** → append-only log of all cert/serial/note/lifecycle operations (14 action types)
- **SnStepStatus** → per-serial per-step status tracking (pending/in_progress/completed/skipped/deferred/waived)
- **SnStepOverride** → per-serial step overrides (fast-track, reversible)
- **BomVersion** → immutable BOM edit snapshots
- **ProcessLibraryEntry** / **LocationLibraryEntry** → reusable process name and location libraries
- **ShopUser** → kiosk-mode identity with `username` (unique), `displayName`, `isAdmin`, `pinHash` (nullable — null means PIN not yet set); PIN-based auth with ES256 JWT tokens; admin flag gates UI features (job creation, job/path deletion, PIN reset); all mutation endpoints derive userId from JWT `event.context.auth.user.sub` via `getAuthUserId()` — no client-side userId override
- **StepNote** → defect/note on serial(s) at a process step
- **AppSettings** → singleton: Jira connection + field mappings + page toggles (5 default PI project mappings, 9 page visibility toggles)

## Known Quirks

- In Nuxt 4, `~` resolves to `app/` not project root. Server code must use relative imports. App code imports shared types from `~/types/` (which maps to `app/types/`). See `.kiro/steering/coding-standards.md` for full rules.
- `app/types/` is the shared types layer: `domain.ts`, `computed.ts`, `api.ts`, `jira.ts` re-export server types for app-layer consumption. App code MUST import from `~/types/` not `~/server/`.
- `server/utils/` exports are auto-imported by Nitro — no explicit imports needed in API routes for `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `getServices()`, `getRepositories()`, `defineApiHandler()`, etc.
- `app/composables/` and `app/utils/` exports are auto-imported by Nuxt — no explicit imports needed in Vue components.
- Test files use vitest's `~` alias which points to project root (different from Nuxt runtime).
- Primary color is `violet` with custom `#8750FF` CSS scale in `:root` variables.
- The CSS has a custom green color scale from the Nuxt starter template — not used by the app.
- `Dockerfile` copies pre-built `.output/` — you must `npm run build` before `docker build`.
- `deploy.sh` has placeholder `SERVER="user@your-server.local"` — needs real values.
- Jira integration is optional and off by default. Two independent toggles: global enable + push enable.
- Serial numbers use sequential format `SN-00001` with a DB-persisted counter (counters table).
- Audit trail is append-only — no update or delete at the repository level.
- All seed data uses `SAMPLE-` prefix for easy identification and cleanup.
- The spec has two "Requirement 15" entries (User Management and Operator View) — a numbering error.
- `vitest.config.ts` aliases `~` to project root (`.`) for server-side imports.
- `runtimeConfig` in `nuxt.config.ts` has `dbType`, `dbPath`, and 4 Jira env vars.
- `USelect` items must never have `value: ''` or `value: null`. Reka UI's `SelectItem` throws if value is an empty string (reserved for clearing selection). Use a sentinel like `_placeholder` with `disabled: true` for placeholder items.
- Nuxt Content v3 requires `content.config.ts` at project root to define collections. The `docs` collection uses `source: 'api-docs/**'` with custom schema fields. Without this file, content queries return empty results.
- Endpoint docs use `endpoint` (not `path`) as the frontmatter field for the API path (e.g. `endpoint: "/api/jobs"`). Nuxt Content reserves `path` for URL routing — using `path` in frontmatter overrides the page's URL.
